# CS320GroupProject

Restructured file system to work with flask for api integration
Basic website is functioning and rules can be sent to backend
for use in python. Still working on getting image to render. I 
will get the e-mail contact form integrated this weekend.

Instructions for running program are in readme inside 
CS320GroupProject directory.

Load python tests into tests directory and update runner.py 
so that it can run all python tests (import your test module 
into runner.py and it will automate the tests).

Significant changes made to file structure and multiple changes
made to html and js files to get everything to communicate.
